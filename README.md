# Kanlen

Create snippets with the `Create snippet from selection` command. Add your own code snippets on the Kanlen web app and use them inside VSCode.

Custom functions created in VSCode or on [Kanlen](https://kanlen.ca) can be used alongside intellisense to easily include your favourite snippets in your code.
